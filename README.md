# Wiktor's dotfiles

To install run `install` while within the repository directory.
Install script will always produce backup of your existing files in `backup`
directory should you choose to overwrite the existing files.



Installing works by creating symbolic links to the files within `dotfiles`
directory. This is done to easily keep track of changes. The side effect of
this solution is that you need to keep the repository somewhere on your disk if
you want the dotfiles to work.
